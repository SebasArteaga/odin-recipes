    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This banana cake recipe uses fresh mashed bananas and buttermilk for super moist results. It was made for me by a friend while I was visiting her after she had delivered her 11th child. I told her, "I should have baked for you!"</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the cake</h4>
    <ul>

        <li>Bake the cake: Pour the batter into a prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove cake from the oven and place it directly into the freezer for 45 minutes.</li>
